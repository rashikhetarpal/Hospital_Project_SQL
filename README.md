# 🏥 Hospital Management SQL Analytics Project

### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital operations data using SQL to derive insights related to patient flow, doctor performance, revenue generation, and patient behaviour for a multi-branch hospital using a relational SQL database with 5 interconnected tables: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Treatments, and Billings. The objective of the project is to demonstrate strong SQL fundamentals along with business-oriented analytical thinking by answering real-world operational and financial questions faced by hospital management.

### 📊 Dataset & Tables Used
- **Source**: Kaggle – Hospital Management Dataset  
- **Format:** CSV files imported into a relational database  
- **Tables:**
    - **patients** – Patient demographics, registration details, and insurance information
    - **doctors** – Doctor profiles, specialization, experience, and hospital branch
    - **appointments** – Appointment scheduling, visit reasons, and status
    - **treatments** – Treatments performed during appointments along with costs
    - **billings** – Billing records representing hospital revenue

 ## 🎯 Business Problem Statements

#### 1. Patient Flow & Operational Efficiency
- Understand how efficiently patients move through the appointment system and optimize doctor availability
- Analyze where drop offs occur to reduce cancellations and no-shows 

#### 2. Revenue Generation & Financial Performance
- Identify key revenue drivers across treatments, doctors, and hospital branches to support better financial and operational decision-making.

#### 3. Doctor Performance & Resource Utilization
- Evaluate doctor workload, experience, and appointment completion
- Rank doctors by performance metrics

#### 4. Patient Behaviour & Engagement
- Analyze patient demographics and visit patterns to improve retention, engagement, and long-term value.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Appointment completion rate serves as a strong KPI for operational efficiency while cancellations and no-shows represent lost capacity and revenue opportunity.
- Revenue analysis shows that a relatively small set of doctors and treatments contribute disproportionately to total hospital revenue.
- Certain hospital branches outperform others despite similar appointment volumes, suggesting differences in patient demand or operational effectiveness across hospital locations.
- Repeat patients generate significantly higher lifetime value compared to one-time visitors, emphasizing the importance of patient retention and follow-up care.
- Doctor workload and revenue contribution do not always scale proportionally with years of experience, indicating that performance should be evaluated using multiple metrics rather than tenure alone.
